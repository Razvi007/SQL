ORDER BY title;

--#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director

LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title= 'Bright Star';

--#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year
